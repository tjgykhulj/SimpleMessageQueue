# Message Queue Experiment

A personal project to build a message queue from scratch, drawing from several years of experience developing messaging systems at scale.

No legacy constraints, no production pressures - just exploring clean design and interesting tradeoffs.

**Current focus**: smart routing and batch delivery semantics.

*Work in progress. Everything is subject to change.*
